GEB - Gödel, Escher, Bach
=========================

This is my fable attempt to collect some ideas I got while reading the
awesome book `Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golder Braid' by Douglas
R. Hofstadter (http://www.amazon.com/dp/0394756827).

CRAB - CRAB Recursive Acronym Broadener

"A recursive acronym [...] is an acronym that refers to itself in the
expression for which it stands."
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym

The name of the program itself is a recursive acronym (naturally) and
also a word play with the Crab character appearing in the dialogues of
the book.
